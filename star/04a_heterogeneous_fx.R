##heterogeneous treatment fx
##There has been substantial interest in the idea of heterogeneous treatment fx, or the notion that different units may be differentially impacted by the treatment.

##ok, so we are well-powered to detect effects of that size. but that (a 200% increase in effect) is pretty extreme. what if we went with a less extreme version

##let's do the less extreme thing a bunch of times so that we don't get confused by a single result
est<-numeric()
for (i in 1:25) {
    mu<-mean.class[class]
    mu<-mu*ifelse(df$g1freelunch=="FREE LUNCH",1,.85)
    df$g1treadss<-rnorm(N,mean=mu,sd=1)
    est[i]<-results(df)[[2]][4,1] #just get the estimate for the interaction
}
summary(est) #we can't reliably distinguish this bit of heterogeneity from 0

##let's look at a more fully-fledged power analysis
pow<-numeric()
for (prop in seq(.5,1,by=.1)) { #prop is going to be the proportion of the effect of small class for frl students that non-frl students observe
    est<-numeric()
    for (i in 1:100) {
        mu<-mean.class[class]
        mu<-mu*ifelse(df$g1freelunch=="FREE LUNCH",1,prop)
        df$g1treadss<-rnorm(N,mean=mu,sd=1)
        est[i]<-results(df)[[2]][4,4]
    }
    pow[as.character(prop)]<-mean(est<.05)
}
pow
##so we are reasonably well-powered if prop is less than about 0.7. what do you make of results for prop=1?


results(df0) #not much evidence for heterogenity in our little example, although obviously we can't rule out small effects (as we just saw)


##one question: what kind of sensitivity in power to the relative proportion of FRL students in the sample would you expect?
